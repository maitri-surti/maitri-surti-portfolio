## Wireframes / storyboards
[Shorthand Link](https://preview.shorthand.com/0IDLlkc0gsXE7KYi)

## User research 

### Target Audience
My target audience are **young adults** who are thrill-seekers and often engage with high-intensity rides and **amusement park enthusiasts** who are regular visitors and may have opinions or experiences related to ride safety. 

### Interview script
| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Understand audiences' thoughts on the graphs|Did the data visualizations about injuries in the amusement parks make information easier to understand?|
||Is there anything in particular that I should do differently to make the data more clear?|
|Evaluate the storytelling aspect of the storyboard|While reading through the storyboard, were you able to follow the problem I am trying to solve here?|
|Gauge if the design supports the call to action for safer amusement parks|Do you think the data visuals and designs support the message of improving safety at amusement parks?|
||How likely are you to assess the safety measures before visiting an amusement park after reading this?|

### Interview findings
| Questions               | Interview 1 (young adult, 20's) | Interview 2 (amusement park enthusiast, 20's) | Interview 3 ((young adult, 20's) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Did the data visualizations about injuries in the amusement parks make information easier to understand? |The user found the visuals clear and loved the cards that highlight rides that cause the most injuries.|Interviewee felt the charts were engaging and they could easily make conclusions by looking at the data.|They really liked the bar chart and mentioned that they would now think twice before visiting an amusement park in New Jersey because of the highest number of injuries recorded there.|
|Is there anything in particular that I should do differently to make the data more clear?|They suggested that I use more varied colors in the treemap because they had difficulty in distinguishing the color for 'operational error' and 'employee error'.|The user mentioned that I could maybe have some sort of an explaination about why there was a sudden hike in the number of injuries in the years 2000 and 2001.|The interviewee mentioned about the treemap being too big and them having to scroll to see the map in sections. They recommended to decrease the size of the treemap so that it becomes more clear and fits in the screen.|
|While reading through the storyboard, were you able to follow the problem I am trying to solve here?|They felt the storyboard communicated the problem effectively and liked how I can personally relate to the problem.|Found the narrative easy to follow but said it could benefit from a stronger transition between data and the call to action.|They felt that the story was clearly communicated and felt the need to assess the parks before visiting.|
|Do you think the data visuals and designs support the message of improving safety at amusement parks?|Yes, they felt the visuals strongly supported the message|Agreed that the visuals conveyed the message but wanted more focus on actionable steps visitors can take.|Thought the visuals were compelling and suggested adding a section showing how safety has improved over time in the recent years, if available.|
|How likely are you to assess the safety measures before visiting an amusement park after reading this?|They are now more likely to research safety measures but mentioned that accessibility to this information is crucial.|They said they would be more cautious before visiting.|Felt motivated to assess safety but wanted a quick checklist to help them evaluate parks more easily.|

### Identified changes for Part III
| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|The visuals were clear, and the cards highlighting risky rides were appreciated. However, some users struggled to differentiate certain colors in the treemap.|Use more varied and contrasting colors in the treemap.|
|The users liked the bar chart but wanted to understand the reasons behind the sudden spike in injuries around the 2000s.|Add a brief reasoning about the increase in injuries in the early 2000s. This could help clarify the data and provide more context to the audience.|
|One of the user felt that the size of the treemap was too large and they would instead prefer to look at the visual without having to scroll through the page.|Try resizing the treemap if possible so that it fits better on the screen without the need for scrolling.|
|Most users felt the problem was clearly communicated, but some wanted better transitions between the data and the call to action.|Improve the narrative flow by creating clearer transitions between data analysis and the call to action. This will help guide the reader from the problem to the solution.|
|One of the interviewees requested to add a checklist at the end to assess the safety of amusement parks|Try to add a checklist which highlights the safety measures one should take before vising an amusement park.|
