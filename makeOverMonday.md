### What the data visualization shows
This visualization shows the universities in each U.S. state with the highest student loan originations for the 2020-2021 academic year, illustrating both the total loan amounts and institution types. Using color-coding, it distinguishes between public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions, with darker shades indicating higher loan amounts. The map reveals notable patterns, such as Arizona State University ($568M) and Liberty University ($447M) having some of the highest student debt burdens. This data viz allows for quick comparisons across U.S states and highlights the financial challenges faced by students at different types of institutions across the country.

### Motivation to choose this data viz
As an international student, I found this visualization especially relevant and insightful, given my own experience navigating educational financing. Coming from abroad, I was eager to understand the student loan landscape in the U.S., where college debt is a significant factor for many students. This map helps me appreciate the scale of loan originations across different institutions, showing where student debt burdens are highest. Having gone through a similar process to finance my own studies, I can empathize with the financial pressures U.S. students face and see how these trends vary by institution and region. This visual highlights not only the importance of financial planning for higher education but also deepens my understanding of the financial commitments many of my peers have made to pursue their academic goals.
