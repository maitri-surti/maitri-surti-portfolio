# About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I am Maitri and my pronouns are she/her!

I am a MISM Graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University interested in domains related to software development, management consulting, and product management. At a very young age, I had a desire to develop something which serves society by making lives simpler. This domain has taught me a variety of concepts and has upskilled my thought process to a significant extent. I have internship experience as a software developer at Amazon and in working cross-functionally with stakeholders and meeting user requirements by taking into consideration the client's perspective of a specific product. I can effectively communicate with customers and prioritize aspects to satisfy their requirements. 

# What I hope to learn
From the Telling Stories with Data course, I hope to learn about presenting the data to users in an efficient way so that they can draw meaningful conclusions from the data visualization. I am also looking forward to learn about selecting the color scheme in an efficient way to convey the relevant message.
