## Changes made since Part II
After Part II, I focused on implementing some of the suggestions that I had gathered from the users I interviewed to make my story and data visualizations better and easier to understand. The very first change that I implemented was of adding a short description about why there was a sudden hike in the number of injuries in the years 1999-2001 and then the injuries started decreasing after that. This additional context will provide users with a deeper understanding of the data trends, making the information more engaging and meaningful.

Next, I rearranged the tree in Tableau in a way that the users could clearly see all the 3 causes of injuries. Initially, the users had to scroll in shorthand to see the 'employee error' in treemap. Another improvement involved resizing and rearranging the treemap. Users had noted difficulty navigating the visualization due to its size, which required scrolling. By changing the treemap layout, I ensured it fits better on the screen, improving the ease of interpretation.

Lastly, I included a checklist highlighting safety measures visitors should consider before visiting an amusement park. This addition aligns with the call to action, empowering readers with actionable insights. Moreover, I also provided some useful links in the call to action section where the users can visit to read through the regulations in that particular amusement park, before visiting. 

### The audience
For my final data story, I identified young adults who are thrill-seekers and amusement park enthusiasts as the target audience. This group is typically in their 20s, often engaged in high-intensity rides and actively seeking out new amusement park experiences. To narrow my focus, I used insights from interviews with young adults, who shared their opinions on ride safety and park experiences. I also made use of platforms like TripAdvisor to interact with visitors who often share their experiences about amusement parks. Based on feedback from my classmates and interviewees, I made several changes to the final project. 

## Final Thoughts
Looking back on the final data story, I am happy with how everything came together. It was exciting to see how the project evolved from just a collection of data points to a story that speaks to my audience. The feedback I got from interviews helped me refine the content, particularly adding a safety checklist and explaining the injury spike in the early 2000s. If I had more time, I would have liked to explore ways to make the story more interactive, maybe by incorporating live data or visual elements that respond to user input. Still, I am proud of how I was able to make the story engaging, informative, and most importantly, useful for those who care about both the thrills and the safety of amusement parks.
