## Changes made since Part II
After Part II, I focused on implementing some of the suggestions that I had gathered from the users I interviewed to make my story and data visualizations better and easier to understand. The very first change that I implemented was of adding a short description about why there was a sudden hike in the number of injuries in the years 1999-2001 and then the injuries started decreasing after that. This additional context will provide users with a deeper understanding of the data trends, making the information more engaging and meaningful.

Next, I rearranged the tree in Tableau in a way that the users could clearly see all the 3 causes of injuries. Initially, the users had to scroll in shorthand to see the 'employee error' in treemap. Another improvement involved resizing and rearranging the treemap. Users had noted difficulty navigating the visualization due to its size, which required scrolling. By changing the treemap layout, I ensured it fits better on the screen, improving the ease of interpretation.

Lastly, I included a checklist highlighting safety measures visitors should consider before visiting an amusement park. This addition aligns with the call to action, empowering readers with actionable insights. Moreover, I also provided some useful links in the call to action section where the users can visit to read through the regulations in that particular amusement park, before visiting.
