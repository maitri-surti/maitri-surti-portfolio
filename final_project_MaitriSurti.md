# Part I: Final project

## Outline

### High-Level Summary
This project aims at exploring and visualizing the patterns and trends of injuries that take place at various amusement parks in the United States. By going through the data on amusement park related incidents over the years, the project will highlight due to what such incidents occur, safety improvements that can be implemented, and ways for visitors and staff to remain informed. As someone who loves roller coasters but is often hesistant to ride on those due to safety concerns, I am very much interested in exploring the factors behind such rare but tragic accidents. This personal perspective drives my motivation to better understand the trends, not only for my peace of mind but also to offer valuable insights to the visitors and staff at the park. 

Through a series of data visualizations, this project will provide a data-driven story that uncovers key information, including which types of rides are most associated with injusries and what safety measures could help reduce the risks. Finally, this project will aim at informing and reassuring roller coaster enthusiasts like myself by creating awareness and highlighting safety measures in the amusement park industry. 

### Project Structure

#### Introduction: The Thrill and the Fear

Amusement parks often bring joy among visitors. I'll start the story by sharing my personal connection to roller coasters about how I love the thrill but am hesitated due to safety concerns. 
#### Background: Understanding the Scope and Rarity of Injuries

The background will focus on the types of incidents that occur and establish why understanding these risks is important for the visitors and the park staff. 
#### Data Analysis: Key Factors Contributing to Amusement Park Injuries

Here, I will dive into the data, exploring when and where the injuries are most likely to occur, the rides that are most associated with such incidents, and the locations which are most affected. The goal is to find meaningful insights from the data. 
#### Visual Storytelling: Bringing the Data to Life

Through visualization, I will try to make the data impactful and tell a story from the data to engage the audience.
#### Solution and Insights: What Can Be Done to Improve Safety?

This section will focus on solutions, highlighting current safety measures and offering practical advice for both visitors and park operators. It will also have a call to action which will give visitors a place to make informed decisions.

### User Stories
As an amusement park visitor, I want to understand the risks and safety measures associated with rides so that I can make informed decisions and enjoy a secure experience.

I can do this by identifying high-risk rides and common causes, and learning practical safety tips to stay aware while visiting amusement parks.

### Summary
Rare but severe amusement park injuries raise safety concerns for visitors.

## Initial Sketches

This graph shows the number of amusement park injuries in the U.S. over the years, peaking dramatically before steadily declining. The sharp drop suggests increased safety measures may have been implemented.

## The Data

The dataset on U.S. Amusement Park incidents is the primary data source for this project. This data source provides information about the incidents that take place at amusement parks in the U.S. It includes accident information like the location, type of ride, number of injuries, and causes of the injuries. 

I plan on using this dataset to create meaningful visualizations that highlight insights like the distribution of incidents based on the location, accident trends over various years, and some of the main factors that contribute towards these incidents. These data viz insights will drive actionable recommendations to imrpove safety in amusement parks. 

Source: [Roller coaster accidents. (2021, June 13). Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenlasch/roller-coaster-accidents/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenlasch/roller-coaster-accidents/data)

If additional datasets become relevant during the analysis, they will be integrated to provide a more robust understanding of the issue.

## Method and medium
For my final project, Iâ€™ll use Tableau to create interactive visualizations and Shorthand to build a compelling story around them. Tableau will help me present the data clearly, while Shorthand will bring it all together with a clean, engaging narrative. This combo will make the project both interactive and visually appealing.
