This project aims at exploring and visualizing the patterns and trends of faalities that take place at various amusement parks in the United States. By going through the data on amusement park related incidents over the years, the project will highlight due to what such incidents occur, safety improvements that can be implemented, and ways for visitors and staff to remain informed. As someone who loves roller coasters but is often hesistant to ride on those due to safety concerns, I am very much interested in exploring the factors behind such rare but tragic accidents. This personal perspective drives my motivation to better understand the trends, not only for my peace of mind but also to offer valuable insights to the visitors and staff at the park. 

Through a series of data visualizations, this project will provide a data-driven story that uncovers key information, including which types of rides are most associated with fatalities and what safety measures could help reduce the risks. Finally, this project will aim at informing and reassuring roller coaster enthusiasts like myself by creating awareness and highlighting safety measures in the amusement park industry.
